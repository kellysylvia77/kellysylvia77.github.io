excerpt: 'Existing HNNs primarily focus on scenarios characterized by homophily, that is, the assumption that connected nodes share similar attributes or labels. This assumption, while effective in many cases, limits the generalizability of HNNs to settings where heterophily is predominant.
- We recognize the absence of robust metrics for quantifying homophily and heterophily in hypergraphs.
- We observe a scarcity of high-quality datasets that represent non-homophilous applications.
- To the best of our knowledge, few works have focused on designing HNNs specifcally tailored for heterophilic hypergraph learning (HHL).'
